# IPASS-Trevor-Oosterhout

This repository contains a hardware library for the mpu6050 sensor. The sensor will be used in conjunction with
an arduino due to make a home security system. The sensor will be able to detect if a person enters the house, and will trigger an alarm. 

include the mpu6050.cpp and .hpp in your Makefile in order to use.

Code contains doyxgen documentation. (needs to be self generated)
