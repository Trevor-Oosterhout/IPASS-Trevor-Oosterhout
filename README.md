# IPASS-Trevor-Oosterhout

This repository contains a hardware library for the mpu6050 sensor. The sensor will be used in conjunction with
 an arduino due to make a home security system. The sensor will be able to detect if a person enters the house, and will trigger an alarm. 

This library is licensed under the boost licence.
