unit of meusurement:
LSB/g
LSB = least significant bit 
g = gravity 
(mV/g)

"the parts feature a user-programmable gyroscope full-scale range of ±250, ±500, ±1000, and
±2000°/sec (dps) and a user-programmable accelerometer full-scale range of ±2g, ±4g, ±8g, and ±16g."

"For power supply flexibility, the MPU-60X0 operates from VDD power supply voltage range of 2.375V-3.46V. "

"The slave address of the MPU-60X0 is b110100X which is 7 bits long. The LSB bit of the 7 bit address is
determined by the logic level on pin AD0. This allows two MPU-60X0s to be connected to the same I2C bus.
When used in this configuration, the address of the one of the devices should be b1101000 (pin AD0 is logic
low) and the address of the other should be b1101001 (pin AD0 is logic high). "

address:
if(AD0 == low)
0x68
if(AD) == high)
0x69
